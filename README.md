# Learning golang for Machine Learning

This repository contains some simple projects in golang. My aim here is to familiarize myself with the Go Programming Language. In the long term I'd like to leverage golang's concurrency model to build massively parallel machine learning systems that can overcome some of the bottlenecks faced by Python or R.
